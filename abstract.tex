\section{Abstract}

This document talks about a revolutionary Integer Factorization Algorithm  and/or Formal Procedure. However, no rigorous mathematical proof is provided as the basis of the procedure is related to the distribution of primes, digit sequences of e and $\pi$ and also the distribution of non-trivial Riemann zeros. This is still an open problem. However this procedure might throw some light on how to go about solving the unsolved mathematical conjecture as list on the website of Clay Mathematical Institute. I have not read any more than the trial division process for Integer Factorization but I am aware that some sophisticated algortihms exist like GNFS (Global Number Field Sieve). Nothing beyond that. For people, looking for rigorous proofs, this article could be a starting point for further research. I am being humble, honest and generous here !!
